Daniel: I don't know. I guess I just need to talk to someone about my family.
User: Okay, what would you like to share?
Daniel: It's just really hard for me to get along with my brothers. We're always fighting and it makes me really upset.
User: Do you want to talk about what happens when you fight?
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so. It usually starts with one of them saying something that I don't like and then we start arguing. It usually ends with me getting really mad and yelling at them.
User: It sounds like it's really hard for you to deal with your anger. Do you want to talk about that?
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know how to deal with my anger. It just kind of builds up inside of me until I can't take it anymore.
User: That sounds very difficult. Have you ever talked to a therapist about this?
Daniel: Yeah, I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication for it.
User: That's good that you're seeking help. I'm glad we can talk about this today. Do you have any other thoughts or feelings you want to share?
Daniel: No, I think that's it for now. Thanks for talking to me.
