Daniel: Well, I am struggling with my mental health issue and I don't really want to talk about it.
User: That's perfectly understandable. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?
Daniel: I'm just really struggling right now. I'm seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it's just really hard.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so.
User: Is there anything in particular that's been bothering you?
Daniel: It's just everything. My parents, my brothers, school. Everything is just really hard right now.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so.
User: I can understand why you feel that way. It sounds like a lot is going on in your life.
User: One thing that might be helpful is to talk to your psychologist about how you're feeling. They can help you to manage your feelings and work through whatever is going on.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess that would be helpful.
User: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about today?
Daniel: No, I think that's all.
User: Okay, well thank you for talking with me. I hope you have a good day.
