User: What specifically is causing you distress?
Daniel: I don't know. I don't want to talk about it.
User: David, it sounds like something is really bothering you. 
Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: I don't know. I don't want to talk about it.
User: David, it's okay if you don't want to talk about it, but I'm here for you if you need to talk. 
Is there anything you do want to talk about?
