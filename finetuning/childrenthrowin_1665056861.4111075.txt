User: In the meantime, here are some helpful tips for dealing with children throwing temper tantrums.
User: First, it's important to stay calm yourself.
User: If you get upset, it will only make the situation worse.
User: Second, try to understand what's causing the tantrum.
User: Is your child hungry, tired, or frustrated?
User: Once you know the cause, you can try to address it.
User: Third, try to distract your child with something else.
User: If they're tantruming because they want a toy, offer them a different toy.
User: Finally, don't give in to their demands.
User: If you do, they'll learn that tantrums are a good way to get what they want.
User: Do you have any questions about that?
Daniel: No.
User: Okay.
