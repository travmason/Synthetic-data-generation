Daniel: I don't know. I'm just feeling really down.
User: That's tough. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
Daniel: Not really. I don't want to burden you with my problems.
User: I'm here to help you, and I want to hear what's going on.
Daniel: It's just that my parents are really stressed out lately, and my brothers and I have been fighting a lot.
User: It sounds like you're feeling like you're in the middle of a lot of tension.
Daniel: Yeah. And now my parents are talking about getting a divorce.
User: That must be really tough for you to hear.
Daniel: It is. I don't know what I would do if they got divorced.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now.
Daniel: I am. I just feel like everything is falling apart.
User: I'm so sorry that you're feeling that way. Can you tell me more about why you think your parents are getting a divorce?
Daniel: I don't know. They just seem really unhappy lately.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really scared and alone right now.
Daniel: I am. I just don't know what to do.
