Daniel: I don't know. 
User: Well, let's start by talking about what's been going on that's been difficult for you. 
Daniel: I don't really want to talk about it. 
User: That's okay, we don't have to talk about anything that you're not comfortable with. 
Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on in your life right now?

Daniel: My brothers are both doing really well and my parents are really supportive, but I feel like I'm just not good enough. I'm seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication, but I just can't seem to get better.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and that can be really tough. 
Is there anything in particular that's been triggering these feelings for you?

Daniel: I don't know, everything just seems so pointless. I don't see why I should keep going when it feels like everything is just going to be hard all the time.
User: It sounds like you're feeling like you can't see a way out or that things will never get better. 
Have you been thinking about suicide?

Daniel: Yes, I have. I just don't see any other way out.
User: I'm glad you're talking to me about this. It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. 
I want you to know that there is help available and that things can get better. 

Would you like to talk about some of the specific reasons why you are feeling this way? 
Or we can talk about some things that might help you to feel better?
