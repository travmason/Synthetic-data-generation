Daniel: I don't know.
User: Well, let's start by talking about what's going on in your life that's causing you stress.
Daniel: My brothers are always fighting and my parents are always yelling. It's really hard to deal with.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess I am.
User: Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises to help calm yourself down?
Daniel: No, I haven't.
User: It might be worth a try. When you feel yourself getting angry, take a few deep breaths and see if it makes a difference.
Daniel: Okay, I'll try it.
User: If it doesn't work or you find yourself getting angrier, we can talk about other options.
Daniel: That sounds good.
User: Is there anything else you want to talk about today?
Daniel: No, I think that's it for now.
User: Okay. We'll talk again soon.
