User: Hi DanielI don't really know. I just feel so lost and alone all the time.
User: That would be distressing.  Do you have friends 
Daniel: I used to have friends, but I don't really anymore. I just don't have anything in common with them anymore.
User: Tell me about that a little. 
Daniel: I don't know. It just feels like they're all moving on with their lives and I'm just stuck here. I feel like I'm losing touch with them.
User: When did you last see them?

User: So can I start by asking you how old you are?
Daniel: I'm sixteen.
User: Are you at school still?
Daniel: I'm not sure. I don't really see the point anymore.
User: Ok.  You mentioned you feel disconnected and alone.  Is that right? 
Daniel: Yes, that's right. I just feel so alone all the time.
User: And how long have you felt that way for? 
Daniel: I don't really know. It feels like forever.
User: I bet it would feel that way.  Has it been months? Or years?
Daniel: It's been a few years, I guess.
User: Ok and have you had thoughts of wanting to escape?
Daniel: Yes, I have. I just feel like there's nothing here for me anymore.
User: That sounds awful.  I am so sorry to hear that. 
Daniel: It's just really hard sometimes.
User: Yes.  It does sound like it.  
Daniel: I appreciate your help.
