Daniel: Hey. I don't know. I guess I'm just feeling really stressed out lately.
User: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: It's just, my mom is a single mom and she works really hard. And I feel like I can't do anything to help her.
User: That sounds difficult. Have you talked to your mom about how you're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, I have. But she's just really stressed too. I don't want to burden her with my problems.
User: I see. Well, it sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now.
Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like I'm not doing anything right.
User: That can be really tough to feel. Do you want to talk about why you feel like that?
Daniel: I don't know. It's just, everything is so hard right now. My brothers are both struggling in school and my mom is working two jobs. I just feel like I can't do anything to help.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure. Do you have anyone you can talk to about that?
Daniel: Yeah, I have a therapist. I've been seeing her for a while.
User: That's great. I think it's really important that you have someone to talk to about how you're feeling.
Daniel: Yeah. I just, I wish I could do more to help my mom.
User: I understand. It's tough when we feel like we can't do anything to help the people we care about.
User: Can you think of any other ways you could support your mom?
Daniel: I don't know. I guess I could try to help around the house more.
User: That's a great idea. I'm sure your mom would appreciate that.
Daniel: Yeah. I'll try to do that.
User: I think that's a really good idea. Do you want to talk about anything else today?
Daniel: No, I think that's it.
User: Okay. I'm here if you need to talk.
