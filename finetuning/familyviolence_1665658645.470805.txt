Daniel: I don't really know. I guess I just need someone to talk to.
User: That sounds like a tough situation. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
Daniel: My family is really messed up. We've always fought a lot, and it's just gotten worse lately.
User: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
Daniel: My brothers and I have always fought, but it's been really bad lately. My parents are always yelling at each other and my dad hits us.
User: That sounds like a really tough situation. I'm so sorry that you have to go through that.
Daniel: Yeah, it's been really tough. I don't know what to do.
User: Well, it sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now. Have you talked to anyone else about this?
Daniel: I've talked to my psychologist, but I don't really feel like it's helped. I'm still really struggling.
User: It sounds like you're doing the best you can. I'm glad you're talking to someone about this. Are you taking any medication for your mental health issue?
Daniel: Yeah, I am. But it's not really helping.
User: It's good that you're getting help from a professional. It sounds like this is really affecting your life. Have you thought about leaving home?
Daniel: I don't really have anywhere else to go.
User: That's a tough situation. Do you feel like your parents are supportive?
Daniel: They're not really. They don't really understand what I'm going through.
User: That must be really hard. Have you thought about getting help from a domestic violence hotline?
Daniel: I don't really know. I don't want to get my family in trouble.
User: That's a valid concern. Is there anyone else you feel safe talking to about this?
Daniel: I don't really know. I guess I just need someone to talk to.
User: I'm glad you're talking to me. I'm here for you.
