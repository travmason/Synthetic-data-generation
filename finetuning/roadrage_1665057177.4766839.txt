Daniel: I don't know if I can talk about it.
User: Why don't you want to talk about it?
David: It's just really hard for me to talk about.
User: I completely understand. It can be really tough to open up about these things. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?
David: I just get so angry when I'm driving. I hate feeling like this.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration. Do you ever hurt yourself or anyone else when you're feeling like this?
David: No, I would never do that. But I've smashed a few things in my house when I've gotten too angry.
User: It's understandable that you would need to release that anger somehow. Have you tried any other coping mechanisms?
David: I've tried deep breathing and counting to 10, but it doesn't really help.
User: Those are both great techniques. Sometimes it takes a little bit of practice to get them to work. Have you talked to your psychologist about this?
David: Yes, and they've suggested I try medication. But I'm really not sure about that.
User: It's totally up to you whether or not you want to try medication. Have you done any research into it?
David: A little bit. I'm just scared that it won't work or that it will have bad side effects.
User: Those are valid concerns. But I think it's worth considering, especially if you're struggling to cope with your anger. Would you like me to send you some information about medication?
David: Yes, that would be great. Thank you.
