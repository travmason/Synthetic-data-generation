Daniel: I don't know.
User: What's going on?
Daniel: Just some family stuff.
User: Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
Daniel: Not really.
User: That's okay. Sometimes it's hard to talk about things that make us feel vulnerable. 
Can you tell me more about your family?
Daniel: I have two brothers and we live with our parents.
User: Do you get along with your brothers?
Daniel: Yeah, we're okay.
User: And your parents?
Daniel: They're alright.
User: Just alright?
Daniel: Yeah, I guess.
User: Do you ever fight with them?
Daniel: No, not really.
User: Have you ever been hit by a family member?
Daniel: No.
User: Okay. Well, it sounds like things are mostly good at home. 
Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
