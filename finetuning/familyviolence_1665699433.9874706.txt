Daniel: Well, I don't really know. I guess I just need someone to talk to.
User: That's what I'm here for. Tell me what's on your mind.
Daniel: It's just, my family is really messed up. My dad, he's always yelling and hitting us. And my brothers, they're both in jail. I don't know what to do.
User: I'm sorry to hear that, Daniel. That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what your dad does?
Daniel: Like I said, he yells a lot and he hits us. He's just really abusive.
User: Have you ever talked to anyone about this before?
Daniel: I've seen a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it's just not helping.
User: I see. Well, I'm glad you're getting some help. I'm here for you too, if you ever want to talk.
Daniel: Thanks.
