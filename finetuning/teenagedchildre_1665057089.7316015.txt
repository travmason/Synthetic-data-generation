Daniel: I don't know. 
User: Well, what's on your mind?
Daniel: I don't want to talk about it.
User: That's okay. We don't have to talk about whatever it is that you don't want to talk about. 
Daniel: It's just, my brothers are really giving my parents a hard time and I don't know how to make it stop. 
User: Do you want to talk about what's going on with your brothers?
Daniel: I don't know. 
User: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now.
Daniel: Yeah. 
User: It's tough when we feel like we can't do anything to help the people we care about. 
Daniel: Yeah. 
User: Can you tell me more about what's going on with your brothers?
Daniel: They're just being really rebellious and my parents are really stressed out about it. 
User: That sounds really tough. I'm sorry you're having to deal with that.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now.
Daniel: Yeah. 
User: I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to support your parents?
Daniel: I don't know. I feel like I'm already doing a lot just by not being like my brothers. 
User: That's a really good point. It sounds like you're doing your best to support your family, even though it's really tough right now. 
Daniel: Yeah. 
User: I'm wondering if there's anything else you want to talk about today?
