User: Hi DanielI don't really know. I just feel so lost and alone all the time.
User: That would be distressing.  Do you have friends 
Daniel: I used to have friends, but I don't really anymore. I just don't have anything in common with them anymore.
User: Tell me about that a little. 
Daniel: I don't know. It just feels like they're all moving on with their lives and I'm just stuck here. I feel like I'm losing touch with them.
User: When did you last see them?

User: So it sounds like you're feeling like you're being left behind by your friends. 
Daniel: Yeah, I guess that's it. I just feel so alone all the time.
User: That would be really tough.  Have you tried reaching out to them?
Daniel: I have, but it feels like they're just not interested anymore.
User: That would be really tough.  I'm sorry to hear that.
Daniel: It's just really hard sometimes.
User: Yes.  It does sound like it.
