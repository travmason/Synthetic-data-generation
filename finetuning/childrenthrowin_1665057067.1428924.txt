Daniel: I don't know, I'm just feeling really down lately.
User: Well, let's talk about what's been going on.
Daniel: I don't really want to talk about it.
User: That's okay, we don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Can you tell me what's been going on in your life lately that's been making you feel down?
Daniel: I don't know, it's just everything. My brothers are always picking on me, my parents are always yelling at me, and I just can't seem to do anything right.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and like you're not good enough.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so.
User: It's okay to feel that way, Daniel. A lot of people feel like that at some point in their lives.
User: I'm glad you're seeing a psychologist and taking medication, those things can really help.
User: Have you ever tried throwing a temper tantrum?
Daniel: No, I don't really do that kind of thing.
User: Some people find that throwing a temper tantrum can help them release all that built up anger and frustration.
Daniel: I don't know, I don't think that would really help.
User: It's worth a try, don't you think?
Daniel: I guess so.
User: Just remember, you don't have to do it if you don't want to. But if you ever do want to try, I'll be here to support you.
