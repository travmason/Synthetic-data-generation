Daniel: I'm not sure.
User: Well, why don't you start by telling me what's on your mind?
Daniel: My friend died suddenly and I can't stop thinking about it.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that. How did you find out?
Daniel: His brother called me and told me.
User: That must have been very difficult for you.
Daniel: It was. I can't stop thinking about how he must have felt in his last moments.
User: That's understandable. It's natural to want to understand what he may have been feeling.
Daniel: But I can't. I'll never know.
User: You're right, you'll never know exactly what he was feeling, but it's okay to imagine and try to understand. It can help you process your own feelings and come to terms with his death.
Daniel: I guess you're right.
User: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
Daniel: No, I think that's all for now.
User: Okay. We can talk more next time if you'd like.
