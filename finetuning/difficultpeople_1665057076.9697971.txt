Daniel: I don't know. I guess I just need to talk to someone about work.
User: Okay, what's going on at work that's bothering you?
Daniel: There's this one guy, Steve. He's just a real jerk. He's always putting me down, and making fun of me. It's like, he gets off on making me feel bad about myself.
User: That sounds like it's really tough for you to deal with. Have you talked to your boss about this?
Daniel: No, I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I don't want Steve to think I can't handle myself.
User: I see. Well, it sounds like you're really trying to handle this on your own. That's commendable, but it's also okay to ask for help. Maybe your boss could talk to Steve, or maybe there's someone else at work who you could confide in.
Daniel: I don't know. I'll think about it.
User: That's a good idea. In the meantime, if you need to talk about this again, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
