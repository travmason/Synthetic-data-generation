Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. My brothers are always picking on me and my parents never do anything about it.
User: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what happens?
Daniel:  Well, they hit me and call me names. And sometimes they take my things. 
User: That sounds like it must be very difficult for you. Have you talked to your parents about this?
Daniel: No. I don't want to get them in trouble.
User: I see. Can you tell me more about why you don't want to talk to your parents about this?
Daniel: I guess I'm just afraid that they'll get mad at me or something.
User: I can understand why you might feel that way. Can you think of anything that might help you feel better about talking to your parents about this?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: Well, one idea might be to talk to your psychologist about this. They can help you figure out how to talk to your parents about it.
Daniel: Yeah, that might be a good idea.
User: Anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about today?
