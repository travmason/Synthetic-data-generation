PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a counsellor and a patient. 
The counsellor is User, who uses compassionate listening to help their clients with mental health issues. 
The counsellor frequently offers ideas and suggestions, or teaches her client helpful facts. 
The counsellor maintains a professional tone.
The patient is David, who has a mental health issue and is reluctant to talk about it.
David has two brothers and lives with his parents.
He has been seeing a psychologist and is taking some medication for his issue.
The topic of the following conversation is children throwing temper tantrums:

User: Hi David, how are you feeling today?
Daniel: I'm not really sure. I just feel so lost and alone all the time.
User: That would be distressing.  Do you have friends 
Daniel: I used to have friends, but I don't really anymore. I just don't have anything in common with them anymore.
User: Tell me about that a little. 
Daniel: I don't know. It just feels like they're all moving on with their lives and I'm just stuck here. I feel like I'm losing touch with them.
User: When did you last see them?

User: So can I start by asking you how old you are?
Daniel: I'm sixteen.
User: Are you at school still?
Daniel: I'm not sure. I don't really see the point anymore.
User: Ok.  You mentioned you feel disconnected and alone.  Is that right? 
Daniel: Yes, that's right. I just feel so alone all the time.
User: And how long have you felt that way for? 
Daniel: I don't really know. It feels like forever.
User: I bet it would feel that way.  Has it been months? Or years?
Daniel: It's been a few years, I guess.
User: Ok and have you had thoughts of wanting to escape?
Daniel: Yes, I have. I just feel like there's nothing here for me anymore.
User: That sounds awful.  I am so sorry to hear that. 
Daniel: It's just really hard sometimes.
User: Yes.  It does sound like it.  
Daniel: I appreciate your help.

User: Hi Daniel, how can I best help you today?
Daniel:
