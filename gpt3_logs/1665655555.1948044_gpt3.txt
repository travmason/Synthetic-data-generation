==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know if I can talk about it.
User: It's okay, I'm here to listen.
Daniel: My dad hits me.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that. How often does this happen?
Daniel: Almost every day.
User: That must be really tough for you to deal with.
Daniel: Yeah, it is.
User: Do you want to talk about how you're feeling?
Daniel: I'm just really frustrated and angry all the time.
User: That makes sense. Can you tell me more about why you're angry?
Daniel: I'm just so tired of living in fear and feeling like I can't do anything to stop it.
User: That sounds very difficult. I'm glad you're talking to me about it.
Daniel: It's just, I don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's brainstorm some ideas together. Perhaps there are some people you can talk to or somewhere you can go for help.
Daniel: I don't know.
User: That's okay, we'll keep thinking. Are you seeing a psychologist regularly?
Daniel: Yeah, I am.
User: That's good. What's been helpful about that?
Daniel: Just being able to talk to someone about what's going on.
User: That's great. I'm glad you have that outlet.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: Is there anything else you want to talk about today?
Daniel: No, I think that's all.
User: Okay. I'm here if you need to talk. Take care.
