==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I'm just really down and I don't want to talk about it.
User: That's tough. It sounds like you're feeling really helpless and alone right now.
Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like I can't do anything right.
User: It sounds like you're being really hard on yourself.
Daniel: I guess so.
User: That doesn't help when you're already feeling down.
Daniel: No, it doesn't.
User: Can you think of anything that might make you feel better?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: What about talking to your brothers or your parents?
Daniel: I don't want to burden them.
User: They might be more understanding than you think.
Daniel: I don't know.
User: What about your psychologist?
Daniel: I don't want to talk to her right now.
User: Why not?
Daniel: I don't know. I just don't want to.
User: That's okay. You don't have to talk to her if you don't want to.
Daniel: I guess not.
User: Is there anything else on your mind?
Daniel: No, I don't think so.
User: Okay. Well, I'm here if you need to talk.
