User:  Hi, what can I help you with today?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really want to talk about it.
User: That's okay, I'm here to listen whenever you're ready.
David: My friend died suddenly and I don't know how to deal with it.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?
David: I don't know, I feel like I'm in shock. I can't believe he's gone.
User: It's natural to feel like that after a sudden loss. How long ago did it happen?
David: A few days ago.
User: Have you been able to talk to anyone about it?
David: I've talked to my brothers and my parents, but it's just not the same.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really isolated.
David: Yeah, I guess I am.
User: I wonder if it would help to talk to someone who's unbiased and could offer some impartial advice.
David: I don't know, I don't really want to talk to anyone else about it.
User: That's understandable. But it might help you to process what's happened if you did talk to someone. Just think about it and let me know if you change your mind.
