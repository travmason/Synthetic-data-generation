==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I guess I just feel really lonely. I don't have any friends or a girlfriend.
User: That sounds really tough. Being lonely can be really hard.
Daniel: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's talk about it. Do you want to be in a relationship?
Daniel: I don't know. I've never had one before so I don't really know.
User: That's understandable. A lot of people feel that way. What do you like to do for fun?
Daniel: I don't really know. I just stay home a lot and play video games.
User: That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you like spending time with your family?
Daniel: Yeah, I do. They're the only people I really have to talk to.
User: That's great. It's important to have a good relationship with your family. What do you think you could do to meet new people and make new friends?
Daniel: I don't know. It's just really hard for me to talk to people.
User: That's okay. We can work on that. I think it would be really helpful for you to join a club or group that meets up regularly to do something that you're interested in. What do you think?
Daniel: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
