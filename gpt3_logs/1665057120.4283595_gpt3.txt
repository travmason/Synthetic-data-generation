==========

RESPONSE:

I'm feeling really burned out from work.
User: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way?
Daniel: I just feel like I'm never good enough, no matter how hard I try. I'm just so tired all the time.
User: It sounds like you're really struggling. Have you talked to your psychologist about this?
Daniel: Yes, I have. But I just don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's brainstorm some ideas together. What do you think would help you feel better?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: Well, one thing you could do is take some time for yourself. Maybe you could read a book or take a relaxing bath.
Daniel: That sounds nice.
User: Yes, it can be really helpful to take some time for yourself. Are there any other things you can think of that would help you feel better?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: That's okay. We can talk about this more next time.
