==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling with mental health issues and I was wondering if you could talk to me about it.
User: Absolutely. I'm here to listen and help in any way I can. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
David: Yeah. I mean, I don't really know where to start.
User: That's okay. Why don't you tell me what's been going on that's been bothering you?
David: Well, lately I've been really struggling. My mental health issues have been really bad and I've been feeling really down. I've also been having a lot of arguments with my family. My parents have been really stressed out and they've been taking it out on me. My brothers have been really distant and I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough. It sounds like you're feeling really alone and like you don't have anyone to turn to.
David: Yeah. I guess that's pretty accurate.
User: Have you talked to anyone about what's going on?
David: I've talked to my psychologist and I'm taking medication for my mental health, but it's not really helping. I haven't really talked to my family about it because I'm afraid of what they might say or how they might react.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really helpless and like you don't know what to do.
David: Yeah. I guess that's accurate.
User: Well, I'm here to talk to you and I'm glad you're talking to me. I want to help you in any way I can. Do you want to talk about your feelings?
David: Yeah. I guess I'm just really overwhelmed and frustrated. I feel like my family doesn't understand me and I can't talk to them about it. I don't know what to do.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really lost.
David: Yeah. I feel like I'm in this big dark hole and I can't get out.
User: That sounds very scary. I'm here for you though. We'll talk through this together. Do you want to talk about your relationship with your family?
David: Yeah. I guess I've just been feeling really disconnected from them lately. We used to be really close, but now it feels like we're really far apart. I don't know how to fix it.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really sad and like you miss the closeness you used to have with your family.
David: Yeah. I do miss it. I just don't know how to get it back.
User: Well, I'm here to support you and I'll help you in any way I can. Do you want to talk about what's been going on with your mental health?
David: Yeah. I've been really struggling lately. I've been feeling really down and I've been having a lot of negative thoughts. I've been having a hard time sleeping and concentrating. I just feel really off.
User: It sounds like you're not doing very well. I'm sorry to hear that.
David: Yeah. It's been really tough.
User: Do you want to talk about what's been going on that's been causing you to feel this way?
David: I don't really know. It's just been a really tough few weeks. I've been feeling really down and I haven't been able to shake it.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless.
David: Yeah. I feel like things will never get better.
User: That's not true. I'm here for you and I'm going to help you. We'll get through this together.
