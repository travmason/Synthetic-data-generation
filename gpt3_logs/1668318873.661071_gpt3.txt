==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling a lot lately. I've been thinking about suicide a lot.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: Everything just feels so pointless. I don't see the point in living anymore.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now.
Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like there's nothing worth living for.
User: That must be really tough to feel that way.
Daniel: It is. I just feel so alone and like nobody understands me.
User: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you're feeling really isolated right now.
Daniel: Yeah. I don't really have anyone to talk to.
User: That makes me really sad to hear. I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything.
Daniel: Thanks. It's just really hard to see any other way out sometimes.
User: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling like you're in a really dark place right now.
Daniel: Yeah. I just don't know how to make it stop.
User: That must be really confusing and frustrating.
Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like I'm never going to get better.
User: I completely understand how you feel. That must be really scary to feel like that.
David: Yeah. It is.
User: I want you to know that I'm here for you and I want to help you through this.
Daniel: Thank you. That means a lot.
