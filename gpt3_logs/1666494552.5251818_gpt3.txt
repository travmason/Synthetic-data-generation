==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really want to talk about it.
User: That's okay, we don't have to talk about anything you're not comfortable with. I'm just here to listen.
Daniel: My parents fight a lot and it scares me.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. Do they fight often?
Daniel: Almost every day. I can't go to my room and Study because they'll start screaming at each other.
User: That sounds very tough. I'm glad you came to talk to me about it.
Daniel: I don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's talk about some options. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together.
