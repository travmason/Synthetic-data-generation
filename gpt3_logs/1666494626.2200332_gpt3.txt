==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know, I just feel really low all the time
User:  I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
Daniel: I don't know, it's just everything. My brothers, my parents, school. I just can't do it anymore.
User:  It sounds like you're feeling like giving up.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so.
User:  It's OK to feel that way sometimes, but it's important to remember that there are people who care about you and want to help.
Daniel: I know, but it feels like it's never going to get better.
User:  Have you been talking to your psychologist about how you're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, I have. But it's just really hard.
User:  I understand. It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now.
User:  I want to remind you that there are people who care about you and want to help. If you ever feel like you need to talk, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
