==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. My brothers always fight and my dad gets so mad.
User: It sounds like you are feeling helpless.
Daniel: Yeah. I try to stop them but it doesn't do any good.
User: It's difficult to see the people we care about hurting each other.
Daniel: My dad hits my mom sometimes too.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that. No one deserves to be treated that way.
Daniel: I know. But what can I do?
User: Well, have you talked to your psychologist about this?
Daniel: Yeah, but they just tell me to take my medication and try to stay calm.
User: That's good advice, but it's also important to talk about your feelings and experiences.
Daniel: I guess.
User: It's okay to feel scared or helpless. We can talk about that more if you want.
