==========

RESPONSE:

I'm not really sure. I guess I just feel really lonely lately.
User:  I'm sorry to hear that. How come you feel lonely?
Daniel: Well, I'm single and I don't really have any close friends. And my family is really busy, so I don't get to see them very often.
User:  That sounds really hard. Have you talked to anyone else about how you're feeling?
Daniel: I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it doesn't really seem to be helping.
User:  It sounds like you've been putting a lot of effort into trying to feel better. I admire that.

User: 

It sounds like you're doing everything you can to take care of yourself, and I'm here to support you in whatever way I can.
