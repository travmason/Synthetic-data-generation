==========

RESPONSE:

I'm thinking about suicide.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
David: I just feel like life is really hard and I can't see things getting better. I'm just so tired all the time.
User: It sounds like you are feeling really hopeless right now. What has been going on that's been making you feel this way?
David: Everything. My brothers, school, my parents. I just can't do anything right.
User: It sounds like you are feeling like you are in a really tough situation. Have you been talking to anyone about how you're feeling?
David: I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on some medication, but it just doesn't seem like it's helping.
User: It sounds like you've been trying to get help, but you're still feeling really down. Have you thought about suicide before?
David: Yeah, I have. I just feel like it would be so easy to just give up and end it all.
User: It sounds like you are feeling really trapped right now. Can you think of anything that would make you feel better?
David: I don't know. I just wish things could be different.
User: It sounds like you wish things were different, but you don't see how that could happen. Can you think of anything that you are grateful for?
David: I'm grateful for my family and for my friends. But I just wish I didn't have to deal with all of this mental health stuff.
User: It sounds like you are dealing with a lot right now. Can you tell me more about your support system?
David: I have a few friends that I can talk to, but I don't really have anyone who understands what I'm going through.
User: It sounds like it would be helpful to talk to someone who understands what you're going through. Would you be interested in joining a support group?
