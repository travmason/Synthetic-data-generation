==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I just feel really down and helpless.
User: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: My brothers always fight and it really stresses me out. Sometimes I can't even sleep at night because I'm so worried about them.
User: That sounds very tough. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with that.
Daniel: Yeah. I just wish I could do something to help them, but I don't know what to do.
User: That's a really difficult situation. I'm wondering if you have ever talked to your parents about this?
Daniel: No, I don't really want to talk to them about it. They get so upset and it just makes things worse.
User: I can understand why you wouldn't want to talk to them about it, but it sounds like it might be helpful to have someone to talk to about this.
Daniel: I guess so. I just don't know what to say.
User: That's okay. We can talk about whatever you want to talk about. I'm just here to listen.
