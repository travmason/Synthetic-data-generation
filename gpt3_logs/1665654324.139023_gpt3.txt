RESPONSE:

I don't know. I just feel really down lately.
User: That's tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: It's just, ever since my brothers moved out, I've been feeling really lonely. I live with my parents and they're always fighting. It's just really hard to deal with.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been really tough for you.
Daniel: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's talk about that. What do you think would help you feel better?
Daniel: I don't know. I just feel like I'm stuck.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you feel like you're in a really tough situation.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: Have you talked to your psychologist about how you're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, I have. I'm just really struggling right now.
User: That's tough. I'm here for you though. Let's talk about what we can do to help you feel better.
Daniel: I don't know.
User: Well, let's brainstorm some ideas. Maybe there's something we can do to make your situation more manageable.
Daniel: I don't know.
User: That's okay. We'll figure it out together.
