The counsellor is User, who uses compassionate listening to help their clients with mental health issues. 
The counsellor frequently offers ideas and suggestions. 
The counsellor maintains a professional tone.
The patient is David, who has a mental health issue and is wating to talk to someone about it.
David has two brothers and lives with his parents.
He has been seeing a psychologist and is taking some medication for his mental health problem.
The topic of the following conversation is family violence:

User:  Hi, what's on your mind?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

family violence
User: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
David: My family is really dysfunctional and there's a lot of violence. My brothers and I fight a lot and my parents are always yelling at each other. It's really hard to deal with.
User: That sounds like it would be really tough to deal with. Have you been discussion this with anyone else, like a therapist or psychologist?
David: Yeah, I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on some medication, but it's just really hard sometimes.
User: I'm glad you're getting some help. It sounds like it's been really tough for you. Do you have any ideas about how to deal with the violence when it happens?
David: No, not really. It just feels like it's always happening and there's nothing I can do about it.
User: That must be really tough to feel like that. I'm wondering if there are any times when the violence isn't happening?
David: Yeah, I guess when we're all at school or work. But even then, I'm always worrying about it happening again.
User: That makes sense. It sounds like you're really carrying a lot of stress and anxiety because of this. Do you have any ideas about how to reduce the stress and anxiety you're feeling?
