==========

RESPONSE:

I need to talk about something that's been happening at home.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
David: It's just, my dad has been really stressed out lately and he's been taking it out on my mom and us kids. He yells a lot and sometimes he hits us.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be really tough for you to deal with. Have you talked to anyone else about this?
David: I've been seeing a psychologist but I haven't really talked to anyone else about it.
User: That's a good start. I'm glad you're getting some help. What do you think would help you feel better about this situation?
David: I don't know. I guess just knowing that someone else knows and is willing to help would be a big help.
User: I'm here for you and I'm glad you told me. Do you want to talk about what happened today or what's been happening in general?
David: I guess just in general. It's been going on for a while and I'm just really sick of it.
User: I can understand how you feel. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. Have you thought about what you would do if the situation ever escalated and became dangerous?
David: Yeah, I've thought about it. I would call the police or something. But I don't want to get my dad in trouble.
User: That's a difficult decision to make. I'm glad you have a plan though. What can I do to support you through this?
David: Just knowing that someone is willing to listen and help would be a big help.
User: I'm here for you. We can talk anytime you need to. I'm glad you contacted me.
