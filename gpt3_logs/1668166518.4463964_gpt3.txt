==========

RESPONSE:

I'm not really sure. I guess I just need someone to talk to.
User:  I understand. It sounds like you might be feeling pretty overwhelmed right now.
Daniel: Yeah. I've been feeling really down lately.
User:  I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling down?
Daniel: Everything just feels so hopeless. I don't see any point in living anymore.
User:  Daniel, it sounds like you're thinking about suicide.
Daniel: Yeah. I just can't keep going through this pain. I want it to all stop.
User:  I'm so glad you're talking to me about this. It sounds like you're in a lot of pain and feeling very hopeless. Suicide is not the answer.
Daniel: I know. But it feels like it's the only way out.
User:  There are other options, Daniel. I'm here for you and I want to help you get through this. Let's talk about some other things that might help you feel better.
