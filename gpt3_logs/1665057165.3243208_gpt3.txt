==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I guess I just need to talk to someone.
User: Okay, that sounds like a good place to start. How are you feeling today?
Daniel: I'm feeling really angry. I had a fight with my brothers this morning and I can't seem to stop thinking about it.
User: It sounds like you're really upset about what happened. Can you tell me more about the fight?
Daniel: We were just arguing about something stupid and it got out of hand. I said some things I didn't mean and now I feel really bad about it.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of guilt and shame about what happened. That can be really tough to deal with.
Daniel: Yeah, I just wish I could take it back.
User: It's natural to feel that way after a fight. But it sounds like you're really beating yourself up about it.
 Daniel: Yeah, I just feel like I'm a terrible person.
User: That doesn't sound like a very positive self-image. Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?
Daniel: I don't know. I just do.
User: Do you feel like this is something you've always felt?
Daniel: No, it's just since the fight. I can't seem to stop thinking about it.
User: That makes sense. It sounds like you're really dwelling on it and it's causing you a lot of distress.
Daniel: Yeah, I just wish I could forget about it.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: Have you talked to your psychologist about this?
Daniel: Yeah, we talked about it yesterday. But I don't know if it's really helping.
User: It sounds like you're feeling like you're not making any progress.
Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like I'm never going to get better.
User: That's a really negative way of looking at things. I'm wondering if there's anything we can do to help you shift your perspective.
Daniel: I don't know.
User: Well, one thing we could try is brainstorming some more positive ways of looking at the situation. For example, what are some things that make you feel good about yourself?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: That's okay. We can come back to that. Let's try something else. What are some things that you're proud of?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: That's okay. We can come back to that too. Let me know if you think of anything. In the meantime, I'm going to send you some resources that might help you with anger management.
