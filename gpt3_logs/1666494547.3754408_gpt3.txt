==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know.
User: That's okay. Sometimes it's hard to know where to start. Can you tell me a little bit about your family?
David: I have two brothers and I live with my parents.
User: What's your relationship like with your parents?
David: It's hard to say. They're always fighting and it's really loud. My dad hits my mom a lot.
User: That must be really tough for you to see.
David: Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do about it.
User: Well, it sounds like you've been through a lot. Have you ever talked to a psychologist about what you're going through?
David: Yeah, I have. I'm seeing one right now and I'm on medication.
User: That's great that you're getting help. I'm here for you too if you ever need to talk.
David: Thanks.
