==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling a lot with my mental health lately. I don't know what to do.
User: That sounds really tough. Can you talk more about what's going on?
David: Yeah. I guess I just don't feel like myself lately. I'm really struggling at school and my parents are fighting a lot.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really alone and helpless right now.
David: Yeah. I just don't know what to do. My brothers are both away at college and I feel like I can't talk to anyone about what's going on.
User: It's hard when we feel like we're the only ones dealing with something. Families can be tough to deal with, especially when they're going through tough times.
User: Have you talked to your psychologist about how you're feeling?
David: Yeah. I'm seeing her twice a week and she's been helping me a lot. I'm also taking some medication for my mental health problem.
User: That's great that you're getting help. It sounds like you're doing everything you can to take care of yourself.
David: Yeah. I just wish things would get better.
User: I understand. It's tough when things feel like they're out of our control. We can only do our best and hope that things will improve.
