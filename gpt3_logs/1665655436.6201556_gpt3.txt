==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know.
User: Can you elaborate on that?
David: I think my family is falling apart and I don't know how to fix it.
User: What specifically is happening that makes you feel this way?
David: My dad yells a lot and my mom cries. My brothers are always fighting and no one ever talks to each other.
User: That sounds really difficult. Have you talked to anyone about how this makes you feel?
David: I've seen a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it doesn't seem to be helping.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. How can I support you?
David: I don't know.
