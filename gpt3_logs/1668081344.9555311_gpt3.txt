==========

RESPONSE:

Hi, I'm not sure if you can help me. My best friend died suddenly and I can't stop thinking about it.
User: I'm so sorry to hear about your friend. That must be really tough for you.

Daniel: Yeah, it is. I keep thinking about what could have happened differently, and how I could have helped him.
User: That sounds like a really painful experience. It's natural for you to want to help your friend, but it's also natural for you to feel helpless right now.

Daniel: Yeah. I just feel so lost without him. He was my best friend.
User: It sounds like you were really close to him.It's normal to feel lost and confused after someone close to you dies. Give yourself time to grieve and don't be too hard on yourself.
