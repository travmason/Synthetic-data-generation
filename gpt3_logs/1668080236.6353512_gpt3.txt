==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling with mental health issues and I was wondering if you could talk to me about it.
User: Absolutely. I'm here to listen. Tell me what's going on.
David: My family is really dysfunctional and there's a lot of violence. I'm really struggling to deal with it.
User: That sounds very difficult. I'm wondering how you're managing to cope with it all.
David: It's really hard. I'm seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it's still really tough.
User: I'm sorry to hear that it's been so tough for you. Do you have any support from friends or family?
David: No, not really. My brothers are both really messed up, so I can't really talk to them about it. And my parents are part of the problem.
User: That must be really tough for you to deal with all on your own. Have you considered getting some professional help?
