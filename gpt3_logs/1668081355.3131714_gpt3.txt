User:  Hi Daniel, how can I best help you today?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I need to talk about something that's been bothering me.
User:  Please go ahead.
Daniel:  I come from a family with a history of violence. My father was abusive to my mother and my brothers, and now my oldest brother is very abusive to his wife. I'm worried that I might end up being abusive too.
User:  That must be very difficult for you to deal with.
Daniel:  Yes, it is. I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication, but I'm still really worried about it.
User:  I'm glad you're getting help for it. Can you tell me more about why you're worried?
Daniel:  Well, I've always had a temper. And when I get really mad, I can't seem to stop myself. I've never hit anyone, but I'm afraid that someday I might.
User:  That sounds like a valid concern. Have you ever talked to your psychologist about this?
Daniel:  Yes, we've talked about it a lot. But I'm still really worried.
User:  Perhaps we can talk about some ways to help you deal with your anger. Would that be okay?
Daniel:  Yes, that would be great.
