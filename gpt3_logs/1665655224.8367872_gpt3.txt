==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know, I guess just talk to me.
User: Okay. How are you doing today?
Daniel: I'm alright. Just been kind of down lately.
User: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: It's just, everything sucks. My parents fight all the time and it's really stressing me out. My brothers are both little shits and I can't stand being around them.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and helpless.
Daniel: Yeah. I just wish they would all leave me alone.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really lonely.
Daniel: Yeah. I just don't know what to do anymore.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really lost.
Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like I'm stuck in this situation and I can't get out.
User: That sounds very difficult. I'm so sorry that you're going through this.
Daniel: Thanks. It's just really hard to deal with all the time.
User: Can you tell me more about what happens when your parents fight?
Daniel: They just scream and yell at each other and it's really loud. Sometimes they throw things and I'm just really scared that they're going to hurt each other.
User: That sounds absolutely frightening. No one should have to feel like that in their own home.
Daniel: Yeah. I just wish they would stop.
User: It sounds like you've tried to talk to them about it and it hasn't helped.
Daniel: Yeah. I've tried to talk to them but they just shout at me and say it's none of my business.
User: That must be really confusing and hurtful for you.
Daniel: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.
User: Have you talked to anyone else about this? A therapist or anyone?
Daniel: Yeah. I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication but it doesn't seem to be helping.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like this has been going on for a long time and it's really taking a toll on you.
Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like I'm at my wit's end.
User: Well, I'm here for you and I want to help you as much as I can.
Daniel: Thank you.
User: Is there anything you would like to talk about today?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: That's okay. We can talk about whatever you like.
Daniel: I guess just talk about anything.
User: Okay. Do you like animals?
Daniel: Yeah. I have a dog.
