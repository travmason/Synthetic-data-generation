Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know, I just felt like I needed to talk to someone.
User: That's a really common feeling. What's been going on that's been making you feel that way?
Daniel: It's just, everything I guess. School, my family.
User: What's been happening with school?
Daniel: I'm just having trouble focus. My grades are slipping and I'm really struggling to keep up.
User: That sounds really tough. And how have things been at home?
Daniel: There's just a lot of fighting. My parents are always yelling at each other and my brothers and I are caught in the middle. It's just really stressful.
User: That definitely sounds like a lot to deal with. Have you talked to anyone else about this, like a psychologist or counsellor?
Daniel: Yeah, I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it doesn't seem to be helping much.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress and pressure. I'm sorry to hear that things haven't been going well.
User: Is there anything in particular that's been triggering the fights at home?
Daniel: I don't know, it seems like everything sets them off lately. They're just really stressed out and they take it out on each other.
User: That makes sense. It sounds like your whole family is under a lot of strain.
User: Have you talked to your brothers about how they're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, we've talked about it a little bit. They're just as upset as I am, but we don't really know what to do about it.
User: It sounds like you're all feeling pretty helpless.
User: I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to de-stress or take a break from the situation at home?
Daniel: I don't know. I don't really have anywhere to go or anything.
User: That's tough. I'm wondering if there's anything you enjoy doing that you can do to take your mind off of things?
Daniel: I like playing video games, but I don't really feel like doing that lately.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you're really feeling down about everything that's going on.
User: I'm wondering if there's anyone you feel comfortable talking to about what's going on?
Daniel: I don't know. I don't really want to talk to anyone about it.
User: That's okay. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. I'm just here to listen.
User: It sounds like you're really feeling alone and like nobody understands what you're going through.
User: I'm glad you're talking to me about it. It sounds like it's really been helping to just get it all out.
User: Is there anything else you want to talk about today?
Daniel: No, I think that's all.
User: Okay. I'm here if you need to talk though.
