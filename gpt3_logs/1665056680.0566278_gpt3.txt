==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling with my temper. I've been taking medication for it, but I'm still having a hard time.
User: That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: It's just really hard for me to control my anger. I've been trying, but it's been hard.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're doing your best.
Daniel: Yeah, I am. I just don't know if it's enough.
User: Have you tried any other methods of anger management?
Daniel: I've tried some things, but nothing has really worked.
User: Well, let's brainstorm a few more ideas then.
