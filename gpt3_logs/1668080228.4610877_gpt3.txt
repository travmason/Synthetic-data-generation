==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling a lot with family violence.
User: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel: 

It's been really tough lately. My brothers and I have been getting into a lot of fights and my parents are always yelling at each other. I hate it when they fight because it makes me feel so helpless. I don't know what to do.

User:

It sounds like you are feeling really stuck in the middle of all this fighting. Have you talked to your psychologist about how you're feeling?
