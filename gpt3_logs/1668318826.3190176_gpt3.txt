==========

RESPONSE:

I've been feeling really down lately and I just wanted to talk to someone.
User:  I'm glad you came to talk to me. How are things at home?
Daniel: It's been really tough lately. My brothers and I have been arguing a lot and my parents are constantly fighting. User: That sounds difficult. Have you been experiencing any physical violence?
David: No, but there has been a lot of yelling and cursing. My brothers and I are always on edge and we don't know when our parents are going to start fighting again.
User: That sounds very stressful. Have you talked to your psychologist about what's going on at home?
David: Yes, I have. They've suggested that I start taking medication for my anxiety and depression.
User: That sounds like a good idea. I'm glad you're getting help from a professional. Do you want to talk about what's going on in more detail?
David: Yes, I do. I'm really worried about my brothers and I don't know what to do.
User: That's understandable. Let's talk about your concerns.
