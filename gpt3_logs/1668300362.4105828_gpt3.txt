==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I guess I'm just feeling really down lately.
User: That sounds tough. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
Daniel: Not really. I don't want to burden anyone.
User: It's not a burden to talk to me. I'm here to listen.
Daniel: It's just that things have been really hard at home. My brothers and I have been fighting a lot lately and my parents are really stressed out.
User: From what you're saying, it sounds like family violence is something that's going on in your life.
Daniel: Yes, I guess it is. I hate it. I just feel so helpless and alone.
User: You're not alone. I'm here for you. Violence is never okay, no matter what the situation is. There are people who can help you if you're feeling unsafe.
Daniel: I know. But it's just so hard. I don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's talk about some options. Have you ever talked to a doctor or a counsellor about what's going on?
Daniel: Yes, I have. I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication.
User: That's great. I'm glad you're getting some help. What do you think about talking to a support group? There might be other people who are going through something similar to what you're going through.
Daniel: I don't know. I'm not really sure if I'm ready to share my story with anyone.
User: That's okay. You don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. Just know that there are people who care and who want to help.
