==========

RESPONSE:

Well, my friend died suddenly and I can't seem to stop thinking about it.
User:  I'm sorry to hear that, Daniel. It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pain right now.
Daniel:  Yes, I am. I just can't believe he's gone. User: 

It's natural for you to feel shock and disbelief when someone you care about dies suddenly. Would you like to talk about your friend and how you are feeling?
