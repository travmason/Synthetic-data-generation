==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know, I just get so frustrated sometimes.
User: Would you like to talk about what's been going on?
Daniel: Not really.
User: That's okay. How about we talk about something else then?
Daniel: Like what?
User: Well, let's see. How are things at home?
Daniel: My brothers are driving me crazy.
User: In what way?
Daniel: They're always fighting and arguing and yelling. It's so loud all the time.
User: Do you ever feel like you're caught in the middle?
Daniel: Yeah, all the time. I can't even concentrate on my own things because of all the noise.
User: That sounds really tough. I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
User: Do you have any hobbies or things that you like to do to relax?
Daniel: Not really. I used to play video games a lot but I don't really have time for that anymore.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate.
User: I'm wondering if you ever feel like you're not good enough.
Daniel: What do you mean?
User: Just that it seems like a lot is expected of you and you're trying your best but it's still not enough.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess that's true. I feel like I can never do anything right.
User: That must be really tough to feel like that all the time.
User: I'm wondering if you ever get angry.
Daniel: Yeah, all the time. I'm so angry all the time but I don't know why.
User: That sounds really hard. It's normal to feel anger but it sounds like it's really affecting your life.
User: I'm wondering if you ever feel like you're not in control of your life.
Daniel: Yeah, I feel like that all the time. I feel like everything is just happening to me and I can't do anything about it.
User: That must be really tough to feel like that.
User: I'm wondering if you've ever thought about getting some help for your anger.
Daniel: I don't know. I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication but it doesn't seem to be helping.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you've been through a lot.
User: I'm wondering if you ever feel like you're not worthy of love or happiness.
Daniel: Yeah, I feel like that all the time. I feel like I'm just a burden to everyone.
User: That must be really tough to feel like that.
User: I'm wondering if you ever feel like you want to hurt yourself or someone else.
Daniel: Yeah, I've thought about it. I don't really want to do it but I just get so angry and frustrated that I can't help it.
User: That's normal to feel that way but it's really important to get help if you're feeling like that.
User: I'm wondering if you would like to talk to me about your thoughts or feelings more.
Daniel: I don't know. I'm just really tired of feeling like this all the time.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you've been carrying this for a long time.
User: I'm wondering if you would like to talk to me about your brothers or your parents.
Daniel: I don't know. I don't really want to talk about them.
User: That's okay. We don't have to talk about them if you don't want to.
User: Is there anything else you would like to talk about today?
Daniel: I don't know.
User: That's okay. We can talk about whatever you want.
User: I'm here for you and I want to help you in any way I can.
