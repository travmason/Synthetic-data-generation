==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling with the news that my friend died suddenly.
User: I'm so sorry to hear about your friend. That must be really tough for you.
Daniel: Yeah, I don't know how to deal with it.
User: Well, first of all, it's important to allow yourself to feel whatever you're feeling. It's okay to be sad, angry, scared, or even numb.
Daniel: I just feel so empty right now.
User: That's completely understandable. This is a really big loss for you.
Daniel: I just don't know what to do without him.
User: Well, one thing you might consider doing is joining a support group for people who have experienced loss. That can be a really helpful way to connect with others who understand what you're going through.
Daniel: That sounds like a good idea. I'll look into that.
User: Great. I'm here for you if you need to talk, too.
