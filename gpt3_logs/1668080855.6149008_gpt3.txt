==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I guess I just needed to talk to someone.
User: That sounds like a really tough thing to deal with. I'm sorry to hear that.
Daniel: Thanks. It's just been really hard lately.
User: Can you tell me more about that?
Daniel: My family is just really messed up. My dad is always yelling and hitting us and my brothers are always getting into fights. I just can't take it anymore.
User: That sounds incredibly difficult. No one deserves to be treated like that.

Daniel: Yeah, it's been helping. But I just needed to talk to someone about it.
