==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. My family is falling apart and I don't know how to fix it.
User:  I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel:  My dad has been really angry lately. He yells all the time and breaks things. My mom is really scared and she's been crying a lot. My brothers are really scared too. I don't know what to do.
User:  That sounds really difficult. Have you talked to anyone else about this?
Daniel: I've seen a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it's not helping. I don't want to tell anyone else because I'm embarrassed.
User:  There's nothing to be embarrassed about. This is a tough situation that you're in. I'm here to help you as much as I can. Do you want to talk about what happened that made your dad so angry?
Daniel:  I don't know. He's just been really angry lately. He yells at us and calls us names. He's been drinking a lot too.
User:  It sounds like he might be dealing with some stressors in his life too. Have you talked to him about how he's feeling?
Daniel:  I tried to talk to him, but he just gets angry and yells at me. I don't know what to do.
User:  It sounds like you're really struggling with this. I'm here for you though. We'll get through this together.
