==========

RESPONSE:

My brothers and I were just in a really big fight and I'm really upset. My parents are always fighting too and it's really hard to deal with.
User:  I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in. Can you tell me more about what happened?
Daniel:  Well, my parents were fighting and my brothers and I tried to intervene and then we ended up fighting too. It was just a really big mess.
User:  That sounds like a really tough situation. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration.
Daniel:  Yeah, I am. I just don't know what to do. It feels like everything is falling apart.
User:  Well, I'm glad you reached out for help. I think it would be a good idea for you to talk to your psychologist about what's going on. They may be able to offer some suggestions on how to deal with the situation. In the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself. Make sure you're eating and sleeping well and getting some exercise. These things can help reduce stress and make it easier to deal with difficult situations.
