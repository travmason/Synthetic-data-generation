RESPONSE:

Just some stuff with my family.
User: Anything you want to talk about?
David: Not really. It's just really hard sometimes.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been tough for you.
David: Yeah. My brothers and I, we don't always get along. And my parents, they don't understand.
User: It sounds like it's been a lot for you to handle.
David: Yeah. I don't know what to do.
