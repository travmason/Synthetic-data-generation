Imagine a very long text message chat log between a counsellor and a patient. 
The counsellor is User, who uses compassionate listening to help their clients with mental health issues. 
The counsellor frequently offers ideas and suggestions. 
The counsellor maintains a professional tone.
The patient is David, who has a mental health issue and is reluctant to talk about it.
David has two brothers and lives with his parents.
He has been seeing a psychologist and is taking some medication for his issue.
The topic of the following conversation is family violence:

User:  Hi, what can I help you with today?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

My dad hit my mom.
User:  Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Family violence is a very difficult topic to deal with. How are you feeling about it?
David:  I don't know. My brothers and I are really scared. We don't know what to do.
User:  That must be very tough for you. Have you talked to your psychologist about it?
David:  Yes, I have. But I don't feel like it's helping.
User:  That's understandable. It can be hard to talk about such a difficult topic. Can I offer you some ideas that might help?
