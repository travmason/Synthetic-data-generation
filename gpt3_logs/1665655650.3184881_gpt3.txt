Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really want to talk about it.
User: That's okay, we don't have to talk about anything you don't want to. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on for you?
Daniel: I don't know, things have just been really hard lately. My brothers fight a lot and my parents are always arguing. 
User: That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you feel overwhelmed. Do you ever feel like you're in danger when your brothers are fighting?
Daniel: No, they would never hurt me. But it's just really loud and chaotic.
User: It's hard to relax and feel safe when there's so much drama going on. Have you talked to your parents about how you're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, I've tried. But they just get mad and say I'm overreacting.
User: It sounds like they're not really listening to you. That must be really frustrating.
Daniel: Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's brainstorm a few ideas. Maybe there's a place you can go to get away from the noise when things are really bad. Or maybe you can talk to your school counselor about what's going on.
Daniel: Yeah, that might help.
User: I'm glad we were able to talk about this. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out.
