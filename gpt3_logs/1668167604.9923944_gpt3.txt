==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I just feel really down lately.
User: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
Daniel: My brothers and I got into a big fight and now they're both mad at me. I just feel really alone.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. Family conflict can be really tough to deal with. What do you think could help you feel better in this situation?
Daniel: I don't know. I just feel like I can't do anything right.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now. Have you talked to your psychologist about how you're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, I'm seeing him next week. And I'm taking medication, but it doesn't seem to be helping.
User: It sounds like you're doing everything you can to take care of yourself, which is really important. Maybe we can talk about some other coping mechanisms that could help you in the meantime.
