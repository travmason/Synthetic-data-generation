==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. 
User:  You sound like you're feeling really lost right now. Would you like to talk about what's going on?
Daniel:  My family is really messed up. My dad hits my mom and my brothers and I have to watch. I can't do anything to stop it.
User:  That must be so difficult for you to see and feel helpless. Have you talked to anyone else about this?
Daniel:  I've seen a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it's not helping. I don't know what to do.
User:  I'm so glad you're reaching out for help. It sounds like you're doing everything you can. Maybe we can brainstorm some other options together.
