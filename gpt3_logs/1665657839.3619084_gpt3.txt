==========

RESPONSE:

Not really sure. I don't want to talk about anything in particular.
User: That's okay, we can just chat about whatever is on your mind.
Daniel: I guess I'm just feeling kind of down lately. My family has been through a lot lately and I'm just struggling to cope.
User: It sounds like it's been tough for you. What's been going on with your family?
Daniel: Well, my brothers and I got into a big fight a few weeks ago and things have been really tense at home ever since. My parents are really upset and they're taking it out on me.
User: That sounds very difficult. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?
Daniel: I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it's just not really helping.
User: It sounds like you're doing everything you can to try and help yourself. Do you have any support from friends or family?
Daniel: No, not really. My brothers are both busy with their own lives and I don't really have any close friends.
User: That must be really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help you?
Daniel: I don't know. Just talking to someone who will listen is really helpful.
User: I'm happy to do that. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
