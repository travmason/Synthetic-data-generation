==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really want to talk about it.
User:  It sounds like something is really bothering you. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
David:  My dad hits me.
User:  I'm so sorry to hear that. No one deserves to be treated like that. Have you talked to anyone else about this?
David:  I've seen a psychologist and I'm on medication.
User:  That's great that you're getting help. Do you feel like talking about what happened?
David:  My dad was really angry and he just started hitting me. I was really scared.
