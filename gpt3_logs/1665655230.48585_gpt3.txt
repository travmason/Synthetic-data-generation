RESPONSE:

I don't know, I'm just really struggling lately. 
User: That sounds very tough. Why do you think you're struggling?
Daniel: I guess it all started when I was younger. My brothers and I would always fight and my parents would get so mad. And then my dad would start hitting us.
User: I'm sorry to hear that you experienced violence in your family. That must have been very painful for you.
Daniel: Yeah, it was. I still have a lot of anger towards my dad. I just can't seem to let it go.
User: It sounds like you are still carrying a lot of pain from what happened. Do you want to talk about what happened in more detail?
Daniel: Not really. It's just really hard for me to think about.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like it's still very painful for you to think about. Maybe we can talk about it another time?
User: In the meantime, is there anything else you would like to talk about?
