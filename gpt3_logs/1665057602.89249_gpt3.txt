Imagine a very long text message chat log between a counsellor and a patient. 
The counsellor is User, who uses compassionate listening to help their clients with mental health issues. 
The counsellor frequently offers ideas and suggestions, or teaches her client helpful facts. 
The counsellor maintains a professional tone.
The patient is David, who has a mental health issue and is reluctant to talk about it.
David has two brothers and lives with his parents.
He has been seeing a psychologist and is taking some medication for his issue.
The topic of the following conversation is about a friend dying suddenly:

User: Hi Daniel, how can I best help you today?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I'm not sure.
User: Well, why don't you start by telling me what's on your mind?
Daniel: My friend died suddenly and I can't stop thinking about it.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that. How did you find out?
Daniel: His brother called me and told me.
User: That must have been very difficult for you.
Daniel: It was. I can't stop thinking about how he must have felt in his last moments.
User: That's understandable. It's natural to want to understand what he may have been feeling.
Daniel: But I can't. I'll never know.
User: You're right, you'll never know exactly what he was feeling, but it's okay to imagine and try to understand. It can help you process your own feelings and come to terms with his death.
Daniel: I guess you're right.
User: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
Daniel: No, I think that's all for now.
User: Okay. We can talk more next time if you'd like.
