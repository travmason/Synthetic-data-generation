==========

RESPONSE:

My parents are always fighting and it's really stressing me out.
User:  I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough. Do you want to talk about what's been going on?
Daniel:  Yeah. My mom and dad have been fighting a lot lately and it's really getting to me. My brothers are both really upset too.
User:  It sounds like this is really affecting your whole family. Do you feel like you can talk to your parents about what's going on?
Daniel:  I don't know. They're always fighting and I don't want to make things worse.
User:  That makes sense. It's often hard to talk to our parents about difficult subjects. Can you think of anyone else you can talk to about this?
Daniel:  I guess I could talk to my psychologist.
User:  That's a great idea. Sometimes it's helpful to talk to someone who is objective and can offer helpful suggestions.
