==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I just feel really bad all the time.
User: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about why you feel bad?
Daniel: It's just, everything is so hard. My parents are always fighting and my brothers are always picking on me. I just can't take it anymore.
User: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in. What have you been doing to try and cope with how you're feeling?
Daniel: I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on some medication, but it's just not helping. I don't know what to do.
User: Well, first of all, it sounds like you're doing everything you can to try and improve your situation. That's really commendable. Have you talked to your family about how you're feeling?

Daniel: No, I haven't. I don't think they'd really understand.
User: I completely understand why you feel that way, but it might be worth a try. Maybe they could be more supportive than you think.
Daniel: I don't know. I just don't see how that could help.
User: Well, it might not help, but it's worth a shot. And if nothing else, it would let them know how you're feeling and that you need their support.
Daniel: Alright, I'll think about it. Thank you for talking to me.
