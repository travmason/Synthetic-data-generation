==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know, I just feel really down and like there's no point to anything.
User: It sounds like you're feeling hopeless.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like I can't do anything right and everyone would be better off without me.
User: Daniel, it's okay to feel this way sometimes, but it's not permanent. I'm here to help you talk through these feelings.
Daniel: I don't know, I just don't see how things could ever get better.
User: Well, let's talk about that. What's been going on that's been making you feel this way?
Daniel: I don't know, everything just sucks. My brothers are always fighting and my parents are always yelling. I just can't take it anymore.
User: It sounds like you feel like you're stuck in a difficult situation.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so. I just wish I could go away somewhere where everything was calm and peaceful.
User: That sounds really nice. Have you ever considered traveling?
Daniel: Yeah, I have. But I don't think it would really help.
User: Why not?
Daniel: I don't know, I just feel like no matter where I go, I'll still feel the same way.
User: Daniel, suicidal thoughts are common, but they're not permanent. With some help, you can get through this and you will feel better.
