I just feel really down and helpless.\nUser:  That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?\nDaniel:  I guess it all started with my brothers. They would always fight and hit each other, and sometimes they would hit me too. I just couldn't take it anymore.\nUser:  That sounds like a really tough situation to be in. Have you talked to anyone else about this?\nDaniel:  I've talked to my psychologist and she's helped me a lot. I'm also taking medication for my mental health problem.\nUser:  That sounds like you're doing everything you can to try to improve your situation. I'm proud of you for seeking help.\nDaniel:  Thank you. It's just really hard sometimes.\nUser:  I completely understand. Would you like to talk about anything else today?","1":"family violence\nUser: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?\nDavid: My family is really dysfunctional and there's a lot of violence. My brothers and I fight a lot and my parents are always yelling at each other. It's really hard to deal with.\nUser: That sounds like it would be really tough to deal with. Have you been discussion this with anyone else, like a therapist or psychologist?\nDavid: Yeah, I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on some medication, but it's just really hard sometimes.\nUser: I'm glad you're getting some help. It sounds like it's been really tough for you. Do you have any ideas about how to deal with the violence when it happens?\nDavid: No, not really. It just feels like it's always happening and there's nothing I can do about it.\nUser: That must be really tough to feel like that. I'm wondering if there are any times when the violence isn't happening?\nDavid: Yeah, I guess when we're all at school or work. But even then, I'm always worrying about it happening again.\nUser: That makes sense. It sounds like you're really carrying a lot of stress and anxiety because of this. Do you have any ideas about how to reduce the stress and anxiety you're feeling?","2":"I need to talk about something that's been happening at home.\nUser: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?\nDavid: It's just, my dad has been really stressed out lately and he's been taking it out on my mom and us kids. He yells a lot and sometimes he hits us.\nUser: I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be really tough for you to deal with. Have you talked to anyone else about this?\nDavid: I've been seeing a psychologist but I haven't really talked to anyone else about it.\nUser: That's a good start. I'm glad you're getting some help. What do you think would help you feel better about this situation?\nDavid: I don't know. I guess just knowing that someone else knows and is willing to help would be a big help.\nUser: I'm here for you and I'm glad you told me. Do you want to talk about what happened today or what's been happening in general?\nDavid: I guess just in general. It's been going on for a while and I'm just really sick of it.\nUser: I can understand how you feel. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. Have you thought about what you would do if the situation ever escalated and became dangerous?\nDavid: Yeah, I've thought about it. I would call the police or something. But I don't want to get my dad in trouble.\nUser: That's a difficult decision to make. I'm glad you have a plan though. What can I do to support you through this?\nDavid: Just knowing that someone is willing to listen and help would be a big help.\nUser: I'm here for you. We can talk anytime you need to. I'm glad you contacted me.","3":"I've been feeling really down lately and I just wanted to talk to someone.\nUser:  I'm glad you came to talk to me. How are things at home?\nDaniel: It's been really tough lately. My brothers and I have been arguing a lot and my parents are constantly fighting. User: That sounds difficult. Have you been experiencing any physical violence?\nDavid: No, but there has been a lot of yelling and cursing. My brothers and I are always on edge and we don't know when our parents are going to start fighting again.\nUser: That sounds very stressful. Have you talked to your psychologist about what's going on at home?\nDavid: Yes, I have. They've suggested that I start taking medication for my anxiety and depression.\nUser: That sounds like a good idea. I'm glad you're getting help from a professional. Do you want to talk about what's going on in more detail?\nDavid: Yes, I do. I'm really worried about my brothers and I don't know what to do.\nUser: That's understandable. Let's talk about your concerns.","4":"I don't know. My brothers are always picking on me and my parents never do anything about it.\nUser: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what happens?\nDaniel:  Well, they hit me and call me names. And sometimes they take my things. \nUser: That sounds like it must be very difficult for you. Have you talked to your parents about this?\nDaniel: No. I don't want to get them in trouble.\nUser: I see. Can you tell me more about why you don't want to talk to your parents about this?\nDaniel: I guess I'm just afraid that they'll get mad at me or something.\nUser: I can understand why you might feel that way. Can you think of anything that might help you feel better about talking to your parents about this?\nDaniel: I don't know.\nUser: Well, one idea might be to talk to your psychologist about this. They can help you figure out how to talk to your parents about it.\nDaniel: Yeah, that might be a good idea.\nUser: Anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about today?","5":"I'm struggling a lot lately. I don't want to live anymore.\nUser:  I'm sorry to hear that. Daniel, can you tell me more about why you feel that way?\nDaniel:  I just don't see the point in living.

I'm just so tired all the time.\nUser: It sounds like you are feeling really hopeless right now. What has been going on that's been making you feel this way?\nDavid: Everything. My brothers, school, my parents. I just can't do anything right.\nUser: It sounds like you are feeling like you are in a really tough situation. Have you been talking to anyone about how you're feeling?\nDavid: I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on some medication, but it just doesn't seem like it's helping.\nUser: It sounds like you've been trying to get help, but you're still feeling really down. Have you thought about suicide before?\nDavid: Yeah, I have. I just feel like it would be so easy to just give up and end it all.\nUser: It sounds like you are feeling really trapped right now. Can you think of anything that would make you feel better?\nDavid: I don't know. I just wish things could be different.\nUser: It sounds like you wish things were different, but you don't see how that could happen. Can you think of anything that you are grateful for?\nDavid: I'm grateful for my family and for my friends. But I just wish I didn't have to deal with all of this mental health stuff.\nUser: It sounds like you are dealing with a lot right now. Can you tell me more about your support system?\nDavid: I have a few friends that I can talk to, but I don't really have anyone who understands what I'm going through.\nUser: It sounds like it would be helpful to talk to someone who understands what you're going through. Would you be interested in joining a support group?","7":"I'm struggling a lot lately. I don't know what to do.\nUser: Can you tell me more about what's going on?\nDaniel: Everything is just so hard.

I don't see the point in living anymore.\nUser: It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now.\nDaniel: Yeah. I just feel like there's nothing worth living for.\nUser: That must be really tough to feel that way.\nDaniel: It is.
