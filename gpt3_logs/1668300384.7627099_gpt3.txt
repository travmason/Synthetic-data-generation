==========

RESPONSE:

My brothers and I were in a fight and they hit me.
User:  I'm sorry to hear that. What can I do to help you?
Daniel:  I don't know. I just need to talk to someone about it.
User:  That's what I'm here for. Let's talk about what happened.
Daniel:  We were arguing and it got physical. They hit me and I hit them back.
User:  Did anyone get hurt?
Daniel:  No, we didn't. But my parents were really mad at us.
User:  Do you usually fight with your brothers?
Daniel:  Yeah, we fight a lot. But it never gets this bad.
User:  What do you think caused the fight to escalate this time?
Daniel:  I don't know. It just did.
User:  Well, it sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated. Is there anything you'd like to do to try to prevent these fights from happening in the future?
Daniel:  I don't know. I guess I could try to talk to them more.
User:  That's a good idea. It's always worth trying to communicate with people before things get physical. Do you think you'll be able to try that next time you get into an argument with your brothers?
Daniel:  Yeah, I can try.
User:  Great. I think that's a really good idea. Let me know how it goes.
