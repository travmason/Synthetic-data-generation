==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I guess I just need someone to talk to.
User: I'm here for you. Tell me what's going on.
Daniel: It's just that, ever since I was a kid, I've always been the one getting picked on by my brothers. And it's not like they do it out of meanness, they just see me as an easy target. But it's really getting to me lately and I don't know how to make it stop.
User: That sounds very difficult. How long has this been going on for?
Daniel: For as long as I can remember. But like I said, it's been getting worse lately.
User: Do you think there's a reason why it's been getting worse?
Daniel: I don't know. Maybe they're just getting more frustrated with me. I know I can be a bit of a pain sometimes.
User: It sounds like you're trying to make excuses for them.
Daniel: I'm not! I'm just trying to understand why they do it.
User: It sounds like you're trying to make excuses for yourself.
Daniel: No, I'm not!
User: It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself from getting hurt.
Daniel: I am not!
