==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I guess I just need to talk to someone about my family.
User: Certainly. What would you like to talk about specifically?
Daniel: It's just that, ever since I was diagnosed with my mental health issue, my family has been really difficult to deal with. My brothers don't understand what I'm going through, and my parents are always asking me how I'm doing and if I'm taking my medication. It's just really hard to deal with sometimes.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been a difficult adjustment for you. Can you tell me more about how your brothers have been reacting?
Daniel: Well, my oldest brother is really great. He's been really supportive and understanding. But my younger brother just doesn't get it. He's always making jokes about my mental health and trying to get me to do things that I don't want to do. It's just really hard to deal with sometimes.
User: That sounds difficult. Have you talked to your parents about how you're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, I've tried to talk to them about it, but they just don't really understand. They're always asking me how I'm doing and if I'm taking my medication. It's just really hard to deal with sometimes.
User: It sounds like it's been really tough for you. I'm sorry to hear that.

User:

It sounds like it's been really tough for you to deal with your family since you were diagnosed with your mental health issue. It must be really hard to feel like nobody understands what you're going through. I'm sorry that you're having to deal with this. If you ever want to talk about it more, I'm here to listen.
