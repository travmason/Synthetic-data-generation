Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

Not really sure. Just feeling really down lately.
User: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
David: Yeah. I guess it all started with my brothers. Both of them are really successful and I felt like I could never measure up. So I started getting angry and lashing out. I took it out on my parents a lot. Yelling, throwing things. It got really bad.
User: That sounds really difficult. I'm glad you're reaching out for help.
David: Yeah. I've been seeing a psychologist and taking medication, but it's just been really hard lately. My parents are really disappointed in me and I just feel like I'm never going to be good enough.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. That must be really tough for you.
David: Yeah. It is. I just don't know what to do.
User: Well, let's talk about some options. What do you think about counseling?
David: I don't know. I'm not really sure if it would help.
User: What about medication?
David: I'm already taking medication. It's just not really helping.
User: Have you tried talking to your brothers?
David: Yeah. We've talked, but they just don't really understand.
User: Well, let's brainstorm some other options. Have you considered therapy?
