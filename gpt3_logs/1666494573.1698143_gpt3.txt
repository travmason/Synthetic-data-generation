User:  Hi Daniel, how can I best help you today?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know if I can keep going. I just feel so tired all the time.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are really struggling. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?
Daniel: I just feel like I'm a burden to everyone. My brothers are doing so well and my parents are always so supportive, but I just can't seem to get my life together. I'm just so tired of feeling like this.
User: It sounds like you are feeling like you are not good enough and that you will never be able to improve your situation. Those are really tough feelings to deal with.
 Daniel: Yeah. I just feel like there's no point anymore.
User: It sounds like you are feeling hopeless and like you see no other way out.

These are really serious feelings, David. I'm glad you are talking to me about them. Have you been thinking about suicide?

David:

Yes, I have been thinking about suicide a lot recently. I just feel like it would be the best way to end my pain.
