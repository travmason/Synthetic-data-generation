==========

RESPONSE:

Well, I'm not really sure. I guess I just need someone to talk to about stuff that's going on.
User:  Certainly. What would you like to talk about?
Daniel:  I don't know. Just stuff that's going on at home I guess.
User:  Is there something specific that's going on that you're concerned about?
Daniel:  My dad hits my mom.
User:  That must be really tough for you to see.
Daniel:  Yeah. It is. I don't know what to do about it.
User:  Well, it sounds like you're feeling pretty helpless right now.
Daniel:  Yeah. I guess I am.
User:  That's understandable. It's hard to see someone we love being hurt.
Daniel:  Yeah.
User:  Have you talked to anyone else about this? A therapist or counselor maybe?
Daniel:  Yeah. I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on medication.
User:  That's good. It sounds like you're getting some help.
Daniel:  Yeah. I guess so.
User:  Is there anything else you want to talk about today?
