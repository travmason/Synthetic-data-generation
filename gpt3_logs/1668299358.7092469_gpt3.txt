==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. My brothers keep fighting and my parents don't do anything about it.
User: Have you talked to your brothers about how their fighting makes you feel?
Daniel: No, they just laugh at me and tell me to stop being a baby.
User: That must be really tough for you to hear. No one deserves to be treated like that.
Daniel: Yeah. It just feels like they're always picking on me and I can't do anything right.
User: Do you feel like you can talk to your parents about how you're feeling?
Daniel: They just get mad at me and tell me I'm overreacting.
User: That sounds very frustrating. Is there anyone else you feel you can talk to about this?
