==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know.
User: What's going on?
Daniel: Just some family stuff.
User: Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
Daniel: Not really.
User: That's okay. Sometimes it's hard to talk about things that make us feel vulnerable. 
Can you tell me more about your family?
Daniel: I have two brothers and we live with our parents.
User: Do you get along with your brothers?
Daniel: Yeah, we're okay.

User: Do you ever fight with them?
Daniel: No, not really.

Daniel: No.
User: Okay. Well, it sounds like things are mostly good at home. 
Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
