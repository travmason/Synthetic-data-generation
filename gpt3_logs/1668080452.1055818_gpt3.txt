==========

RESPONSE:

I'm struggling with my mental health and I was hoping to talk to someone about it.
User: Certainly. How are you doing?
Daniel: Not great. My parents are constantly fighting and it's really taking a toll on me.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. How long has this been going on?
Daniel: It started when I was a kid and it's just been getting worse and worse.
User: That sounds really tough. Have you ever talked to anyone about this before?
Daniel: I've seen a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it's not really helping.
User: It sounds like you've been through a lot. I'm glad you're reaching out for help. I think it would be really beneficial for you to talk to someone who can understand what you're going through.
User: Would you like me to provide some resources?
