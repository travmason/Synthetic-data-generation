Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I need to talk about something that's been bothering me.
User:  Of course, what's going on?
Daniel:  It's my brothers. They're always getting into fights and yelling at each other. And sometimes they hit each other. I don't know what to do.
User:  That sounds really tough. Do you feel like you're in danger when they fight like that?
Daniel:  No, I don't think so. But it just makes me really upset. I don't know why they can't just get along.
User:  It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration. Have you talked to your parents about this?
Daniel:  Yeah, I've talked to them about it. But they just tell me to stay out of it. They say it's not my business.
User:  That must be really confusing and frustrating for you. I'm wondering if you've talked to your psychologist about this?
Daniel:  Yeah, I have. They say that I should try to stay calm and not let it bother me so much. But it's hard.
User:  It sounds like it's really difficult for you to deal with this situation. Do you have any ideas about what might help you feel better?
Daniel:  I don't know. I just wish things were different.
User:  That's understandable. It's hard when we're stuck in a situation that we don't like and we can't change it. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together about how to cope with this.
