Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I'm feeling really low and thinking about suicide.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling this way?
Daniel: I just feel like there's no point in living anymore. Everything feels so pointless and I can't see how anything will get better.
User: That must be really tough for you to feel that way. Have you been feeling like this for a long time or is it more recent?
Daniel: It's been building for a while but it's really bad now.
User: OK, thank you for sharing that with me. I'm glad you're reaching out for help. I think it would be a good idea for you to talk to your psychologist about how you're feeling. In the meantime, here are some resources that might be helpful for you:
