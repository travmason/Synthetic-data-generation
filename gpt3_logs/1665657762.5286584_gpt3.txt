==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. Just listen I guess.
User: I can do that. What's on your mind?
Daniel: I don't really want to talk about it.
User: Can you give me a general idea of what's going on?
Daniel: My family is really messed up. User:

I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

Daniel:

My dad gets really angry and sometimes he hits my mom. My brothers and I have to try and stop him, but it's really hard. I'm scared all the time that something bad is going to happen.

User:

It sounds like you're living in a very difficult situation. I'm glad you're reaching out for help. Can you tell me how you're feeling?

Daniel:

I feel scared all the time. I worry about my mom and my brothers. I just wish things could be different.

User:

It sounds like you're feeling a lot of fear and pain. I'm here for you and I'll do whatever I can to help. Do you have any ideas of what you would like to do to change the situation?

Daniel:

I don't know. I just wish things would be different.

User:

It's understandable that you feel that way. Can you think of anything that you could do to make the situation better? Even if it's just a small step, it can make a big difference.

Daniel:

I don't know. I just wish things would change.
