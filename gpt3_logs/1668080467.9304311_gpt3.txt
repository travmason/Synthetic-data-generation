Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I guess I just need to talk to someone.
User: Okay, that sounds like a good idea. Do you want to talk about what's been going on?
Daniel: I don't know. It's just, everything is so fucked up.
User: Can you elaborate on that?
Daniel: My brothers and I, we used to be really close. But lately, ever since our parents started fighting, it's like we're all on edge all the time. And I can't stand it. I just feel so angry all the time.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration. That makes sense, considering what you're going through.
Daniel: Yeah. I just, I don't know what to do. It feels like everything is falling apart.
User: That must be really tough for you to deal with. Have you talked to your psychologist about this?
Daniel: Yeah, I have. But it's just, I don't know, it doesn't seem like it's helping.
User: Well, it sounds like you're doing the best you can under the circumstances. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.
Daniel: Yeah. I just wish things would go back to the way they were.
User: That's understandable. Change can be hard, especially when it's something that's beyond your control.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: Is there anything in particular that you're worried about?
Daniel: I don't know. I guess I'm just worried that things are never going to get better.
User: That's a valid concern. It's natural to feel like that when you're going through something tough.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: Have you considered talking to your brothers about how you're feeling?
Daniel: I don't know. I don't really want to burden them with my problems.
User: That's understandable. But it might be helpful to talk to them about what's going on. They might be able to offer some support.
Daniel: Yeah. I guess that's true.
User: It's also important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. We're here to support you.
Daniel: Yeah. Thank you.
