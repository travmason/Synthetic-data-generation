User:  Hi, what's on your mind?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

Not really sure. Just feel kind of down, I guess.
User: That's tough. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
David: Not really. I don't want to burden anyone.
User: I'm here to listen, no matter what. It's my job.
David: I don't know. It's just, my brothers and I, we used to fight a lot when we were kids. And now my parents are getting divorced and it's all just really hard to deal with.
User: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about that?
David: I don't know. It's just, I feel like I can't do anything right. Whenever I try to talk to my brothers about it, they just shut me out. And my parents, they're always fighting and it's just really hard to deal with.
User: That sounds like a lot to deal with. I'm here for you, though. We can talk about whatever you want.
