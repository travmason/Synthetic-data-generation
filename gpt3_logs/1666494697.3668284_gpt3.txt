==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I guess I just don't really want to talk about it.
User:  That's understandable. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?
Daniel:  My brothers and I got into a fight and now they're both really mad at me. I don't know what to do.
User:  That sounds difficult. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about what happened?
Daniel:  Not really. I don't know. It just makes me really upset.
User:  That's okay. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. Is there anything else on your mind?
