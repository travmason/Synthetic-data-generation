User:  Hi Daniel, what brings you here today?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I just feel really down all the time and I just wanted to talk to someone about it.
User: It sounds like you're feeling really lonely and helpless.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so. My brothers always pick on me and my parents never seem to care.
User: That sounds really tough. How do you usually handle when your brothers pick on you?
Daniel: I just try to ignore them, but it's really hard.
User: Yeah, that sounds tough. Do you ever talk to your parents about how you're feeling?
Daniel: No, they would just tell me to toughen up and that I'm being too sensitive.
User: That doesn't sound like it would be very helpful. Have you ever talked to a counsellor or psychologist about how you're feeling?
Daniel: Yeah, I've been seeing a psychologist and I'm on some medication. It's helped a bit, but I still don't feel like I can really talk to anyone about how I'm feeling.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you don't really feel like you have anyone to talk to who really understands what you're going through.
Daniel: Yeah, that's true.
User: Well, I'm here to listen and I really appreciate you sharing your story with me.
