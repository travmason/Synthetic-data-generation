==========

RESPONSE:

I was hoping to talk about family violence.
User: You said you were hoping to talk about family violence. Would you like to talk about what's going on?
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so. It's just, my family is really violent and I don't know how to deal with it.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. How long has this been going on?
Daniel: For as long as I can remember. My brothers are always hitting each other and my parents argue all the time. They've even hit each other in front of me.
User: That must be really tough for you to see. Do you feel like you're in danger when they're fighting?
Daniel: No, I don't think so. But it's just really hard to see them like that all the time.
User: I can imagine. It sounds like you've been carrying this for a long time.

David, it sounds like you've been through a lot. I'm wondering if you've ever talked to anyone about this before?
