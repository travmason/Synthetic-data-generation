PROMPT:

Imagine a really long text message chat log between a counsellor and a patient. 
The counsellor is User, who uses compassionate listening to help their clients with mental health issues. 
The counsellor frequently offers ideas and suggestions, or teaches her client helpful facts. 
The counsellor maintains a professional tone.
The patient is David, who has a mental health issue and is reluctant to talk about it.
David has two brothers and lives with his parents.
He has been seeing a psychologist and is taking some medication for his issue.
The topic of the following conversation is road rage:

User: Hi Daniel, how can I best help you today?
Daniel:

==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know if I can talk about it.
User: Why don't you want to talk about it?
David: It's just really hard for me to talk about.
User: I completely understand. It can be really tough to open up about these things. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?
David: I just get so angry when I'm driving. I hate feeling like this.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration. Do you ever hurt yourself or anyone else when you're feeling like this?
David: No, I would never do that. But I've smashed a few things in my house when I've gotten too angry.
User: It's understandable that you would need to release that anger somehow. Have you tried any other coping mechanisms?
David: I've tried deep breathing and counting to 10, but it doesn't really help.
User: Those are both great techniques. Sometimes it takes a little bit of practice to get them to work. Have you talked to your psychologist about this?
David: Yes, and they've suggested I try medication. But I'm really not sure about that.
User: It's totally up to you whether or not you want to try medication. Have you done any research into it?
David: A little bit. I'm just scared that it won't work or that it will have bad side effects.
User: Those are valid concerns. But I think it's worth considering, especially if you're struggling to cope with your anger. Would you like me to send you some information about medication?
David: Yes, that would be great. Thank you.
