==========

RESPONSE:

I don't know. I just feel really down all the time.
User: That's tough. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling down?
Daniel: I don't know. Everything just seems pointless.
User: That sounds very discouraging. Can you think of anything that brings you joy?
Daniel: Not really.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you're going through a lot.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: I'm here for you, though. We'll get through this together.
Daniel: Thanks.
User: Do you want to talk about what's going on in your life that might be causing this depression?
Daniel: I don't know. My brothers are both doing so well and I feel like I can't measure up.
User: That sounds like a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: It's okay to not be perfect. We all have different strengths and weaknesses.
Daniel: I guess.
User: Is there anything else on your mind?
Daniel: No. I just feel really down all the time.
User: That's tough. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling down?
Daniel: I don't know. Everything just seems pointless.
User: That sounds very discouraging. Can you think of anything that brings you joy?
Daniel: Not really.
User: That's understandable. It sounds like you're going through a lot.
Daniel: Yeah.
User: I'm here for you, though. We'll get through this together.
Daniel: Thanks.
