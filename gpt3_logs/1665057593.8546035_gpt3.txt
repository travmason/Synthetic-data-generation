==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I guess I just need someone to talk to.
User: I'm here for you. Let's talk about what's going on.
Daniel: I don't really want to talk about it.
User: That's okay. We don't have to talk about anything you don't want to.
Daniel: It's just that, everything feels so hopeless. I don't see any point in living anymore.
User: That must be really tough for you to feel that way.
Daniel: Yeah. It is.
User: Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?
Daniel: I don't know. It just seems like everything is against me. I can't do anything right. My brothers are both doing better than me. They're both successful and have great lives. And my parents are always comparing me to them. I just can't live up to their expectations.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure.
Daniel: Yeah. I am.
User: Have you ever talked to anyone about how you're feeling?
Daniel: I've seen a psychologist and I'm on medication, but it doesn't seem to be helping.
User: It sounds like you're doing everything you can.
Daniel: I don't know. I just feel like it's not enough.
User: Daniel, it's okay to feel like that. You're allowed to feel whatever you're feeling.
Daniel: I know. But I just can't help it.
User: Do you ever feel like harming yourself?
Daniel: Yeah. I've thought about it.
User: Have you ever tried to hurt yourself?
Daniel: No. I would never do that.
User: That's good. It's important to remember that even though things might seem bad now, they can always get better.
Daniel: I don't know.
User: What about your brothers? You said they're doing well.
Daniel: Yeah. They are.
User: That must make you happy.
Daniel: It does. But it also makes me feel like I'm not good enough.
User: That's a common feeling, but it doesn't mean it's true.
Daniel: I know. But it's hard to believe that when I see how successful they are.
User: It sounds like you're feeling like you're not good enough in general.
Daniel: Yeah. I am.
User: That's something we can work on.
