==========

RESPONSE:

I'm not really sure. I guess I just needed to talk to someone.
User: That sounds like a tough thing to deal with. I'm sorry to hear about your friend.
Daniel: Yeah, it's been really hard. I didn't even get to say goodbye.
User: That must have been really tough for you. Do you want to talk about it?
Daniel: I don't know. It's just, every time I think about it, I feel so angry and upset.
User: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of different things. That's totally normal.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so. But it doesn't make it any easier.
User: No, I can imagine it wouldn't. It sounds like you're doing the best you can.
