That sounds really tough. Do you want to talk about what's been going on?\nDaniel:  Yeah. My mom and dad have been fighting a lot lately and it's really getting to me. My brothers are both really upset too.\nUser:  It sounds like this is really affecting your whole family. Do you feel like you can talk to your parents about what's going on?\nDaniel:  I don't know. They're always fighting and I don't want to make things worse.\nUser:  That makes sense. It's often hard to talk to our parents about difficult subjects. Can you think of anyone else you can talk to about this?\nDaniel:  I guess I could talk to my psychologist.\nUser:  That's a great idea. Sometimes it's helpful to talk to someone who is objective and can offer helpful suggestions.","1":"I'm not really sure. I guess I just need someone to talk to.\nUser:  I understand.

I want it to all stop.\nUser:  I'm so glad you're talking to me about this. It sounds like you're in a lot of pain and feeling very hopeless. Suicide is not the answer.\nDaniel: I know. But it feels like it's the only way out.\nUser:  There are other options, Daniel. I'm here for you and I want to help you get through this. Let's talk about some other things that might help you feel better.","2":"A friend of mine died recently and I'm taking it really hard.\nUser: I'm sorry to hear that.
