==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really know. I just, I guess I just feel really down lately and I don't know what to do.
User: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are going through a tough time.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess you could say that.
User: Well, I'm here to help you in any way I can. Do you want to talk about what's going on?
Daniel: I don't know. It's just, everything sucks and I don't see any point in living anymore.
User: It sounds like you are feeling very hopeless right now.
Daniel: Yeah, I guess so.
