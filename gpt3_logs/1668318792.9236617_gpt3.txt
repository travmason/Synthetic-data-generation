==========

RESPONSE:

I'm not sure. I just feel really down and helpless.
User:  That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?
Daniel:  I guess it all started with my brothers. They would always fight and hit each other, and sometimes they would hit me too. I just couldn't take it anymore.
User:  That sounds like a really tough situation to be in. Have you talked to anyone else about this?
Daniel:  I've talked to my psychologist and she's helped me a lot. I'm also taking medication for my mental health problem.
User:  That sounds like you're doing everything you can to try to improve your situation. I'm proud of you for seeking help.
Daniel:  Thank you. It's just really hard sometimes.
User:  I completely understand. Would you like to talk about anything else today?
