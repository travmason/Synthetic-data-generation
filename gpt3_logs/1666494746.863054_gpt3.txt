==========

RESPONSE:

I don't really want to talk about it.
User: That's okay, we don't have to talk about anything you don't want to. Can you tell me a little bit about your family?
David: I have two brothers and we live with our parents.
User: Do you get along with your brothers?
David: Yeah, we're pretty close.
User: That's good. Do you ever fight with them?
David: Yeah, sometimes we'll get into arguments, but nothing serious.
User: Has anyone in your family ever been violent with each other?
David: My dad used to hit my mom when we were kids. But he stopped when she threatened to leave him.
User: That must have been really tough for you to see.
David: Yeah, it was. I was really scared that he would hurt her.
User: What about now, do you feel like your family is safe?
David: Yeah, I think so. Things have been better since my dad stopped hitting her.
